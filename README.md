Project Liquid
==============

Project Liquid is the codename of the new ACM@UIUC website.  The website project encompasses a lot of different web applications, which have been broken into seperate Django apps.  They are detailed below:

The Structure of Liquid
-----------------------

### Blog
The blog is a small CMS designed to post news and information about ACM@UIUC.  It should contain posts, categories, tags, authors, comments, etc.

### Cats
Every good website needs cats.  Authorized by Verbal Executive Order #843 via Kellie Rios, acting ACM@UIUC chair, the cats app will show pictures of cute cats to the acm users and public.

### Events
Due to ACM@UIUC's large size and many SIGs, we need a robust calendar system to manage meeting times.  SIG chairs should be able to manage their events and post them to their own as well as a central calendar.

### Jobs
The jobs app should allow companies to post available positions the possible also host an online resume book of users.

### Projects
This app will manage the SIGs/Groups and their projects.  To begin with, it should support project urls and descriptions, but in the future should be a fully featured project management system.

### Tutoring
Tutoring is a supposed to be an implementation of the /mentoring project, designed to connect students, faculty, and the general public together for a collaborative learning effort.  For more information, check out [/mentoring](http://blog.dianakimball.com/mentoring).
