  Nineteen years ago, the student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery at the University of Illinois (ACM@UIUC) held its first computing conference. 150 students from across the midwest attended the event, which was supported by 14 corporations.
</p>
<p>
  Since its beginning, the conference has grown to include the MechMania programming contest and a job fair. This year, we're proud to welcome you to the 20th annual conference from September 25-28, 2014, at the Urbana-Champaign campus. We expect to have over 700 student attendees and more than 25 corporate sponsors.
</p>
<p>
  ACM could not host Reflections | Projections without the generous support of our sponsors. Their donations fund all the events and help keep student fees low.
