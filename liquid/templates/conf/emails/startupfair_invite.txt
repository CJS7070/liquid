Dear {{ company.first_name }},

My name is {{ user.get_full_name }} and I am part of Founders, a student entrepreneurship group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Together with the student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery, we are hosting an on-campus startup career fair this fall as part of the Reflections | Projections Conference. I am contacting you to see if {{ company.company_name }} is interested in participating.

The Reflections | Projections conference is a student-run event which brings together over 800 students from the Midwest to attend a variety of speaking events and computing workshops held throughout the weekend. Past speakers have included Alexis Ohanian, Larry Wall, Stephen Wolfram, Steve Wozniak, Blake Ross (creator of Firefox), Joel Spolsky, Eric Traut, and Ian Murdock (the "Ian" in Debian).

The Startup Fair will be held on October 1st, 2015 from 5-8PM on the first floor of the Siebel Center in the atrium. Last year, there were 24 companies at the fair, and this year the fair will be even bigger. The price for a Startup Fair booth is $400.

Registration ensures:

- A booth in the Siebel Center atrium, home of the Computer Science department.
- Complimentary meals for the entire weekend
- Help with shipping and logistics
