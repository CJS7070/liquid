Dear {{ company.first_name }},

We're excited to extend an invitation to {{ company.company_name }} to attend this year's annual Reflections | Projections job fair. The job fair will be held on Friday, September 30th, 2016. Reflections | Projections is one of the largest student run conferences in the US, with over 1,200 students coming every year to the job fair, and we'd love to have {{ company.company_name }} involved.

To read about last year's Reflections | Projections, please check out this article on Medium: https://medium.com/@acmuiuc/reflections-projections-2015-d4168b45e89e

The lowest tier level, Megabyte, will look almost the same as getting a spot at
the job fair in the past. The price is the same as years past, at $1,250.

The Megabyte sponsorship tier includes the following:
 - A booth in the Siebel Center Atrium
 - Meals during the event
 - Shipping and logistical accommodation
 - Parking during the event

If you're interested in sponsoring at a higher level than Megabyte, please reach out to us at jobfair@acm.uiuc.edu.

We look forward to working with {{ company.company_name }}! Again, if you have any further questions or requests, don't hesitate to contact us at jobfair@acm.uiuc.edu.

Thank You,
