Dear {{ company.first_name }},

We're excited to extend an invitation to {{ company.company_name }} to attend this year's annual Reflections | Projections job fair. The job fair will be held on Friday, October 2nd, 2015. Reflections | Projections is one of the largest student run conferences in the US, with over 1,200 students coming every year to the job fair, and we'd love to have {{ company.company_name }} involved.

We've revamped what attendance will look like this year from the ground up. Notably, attendance is only possible through sponsorship in our new tiered sponsorship model. We're offering companies more ways to get involved, and there are some fantastic new ways to get more out of Reflections | Projections. To learn more about different sponsorship opportunities, see the following pdf (http://acm.illinois.edu/static/RP_2015_Sponsorship_Opportunities.pdf), which breaks down the tiers into more specific detail.

The lowest tier level, Sapphire, will look almost the same as getting a spot at
the job fair in the past. The price is the same as years past, at $1,250.

The Sapphire sponsorship tier includes the following:
 - A booth in the Siebel Center Atrium
 - Meals during the event
 - Shipping and logistical accommodation
 - Parking during the event
 - Advertising for {{ company.company_name }} on the Reflections | Projections website
 - One-Year sponsorship to ACM@UIUC at the Bronze Sponsor level

If you're interested in sponsoring at a higher level than Sapphire, please reach out to us at corporate@acm.uiuc.edu. Be aware that there are separate waiting lists for each tier.

The official job fair registration form is linked below:
